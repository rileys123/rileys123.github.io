# Project Overview
This website serves as a personal project hub, combining my interests in coding, design, and artwork. Each page was designed to express both technical and creative sides through fun designs and concepts.

---

# Features
- **Interactive Home Page** - hover over objects (laptop, t-shirt, sketchbook) to explore different pages
- **Coding Projects Page** - icons link to project descriptions and repositories
- **Artwork Gallery** - scrollable showcase of my art with design descriptions
- **Apparel Design Carousel** - rotating gallery of my original closet designs

---

# Build Process
1. Forked niklasbuschmann/contrast as a base structure and heavily customized the layout/CSS for a more interactive theme
2. Digitally drew home page in Concepts and designed hover effects on icons
3. Designed carousel script for closet navigation, added links to designs
4. Iterated through visuals and UI layout through trial and error

# Future Improvements
- Expand the homepage “desk” with more clickable items like music, writing, etc.
- Add animations for more fun, personal pop!
